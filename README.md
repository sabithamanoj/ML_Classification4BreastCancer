## Introduction
This project demonstrates a full machine learning workflow, from data exploration and preprocessing to model selection and evaluation. It aims to diagnose breast cancer as benign or malignant based on input features.

## Project Overview
- **Objective**: Diagnose breast cancer based on input features by developing a machine learning model.
- **Techniques Used**: Data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training and evaluation, hyperparameter tuning.
- **Libraries Used**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, XGBoost, LightGBM.


## Dataset 
The dataset is the breast cancer dataset from Kaggle:
